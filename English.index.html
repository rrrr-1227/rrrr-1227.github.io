<h1>Pepepe-club Theater Company</h1>
	  <p> Pepepe-club Theater Company was founded in 2018 by young members (born in 1995-1997) in Japan. "Pepepe" means first sound of "people" in English. The company sees ourselves as something before "people", while thinking about people in the state of born.<br>
　The company makes dramas which deconstruct the devision between performers and audiences. We think this deconstruction will make the connections between them, and let people discuss social problems (for example, global warming, wars, poverty, economic inequality) . We seek to find a way to communicate each other who have different background. Arts can play the important role for communications to solve (or resolve) the social and global problems, we believe. <br>
　Now, the company has 7 members, Yamato Miyazawa (playwright, director), Haruhi Ishizuka (actress), Reina Sato(actress), Miyuki Kumano(actress), Emi Arima (make-up), Rina Kimura(lighting), Minato Suzuki (producer). All of them were born in 1990's.<br><br>
 The company has three creeds to work.<br>
　1. To make public places where performers and audiences discuss our works and society.<br>
　2. To make performances which can be done only by Engeki (which means the kinds of   performing arts in Japanese).<br>
　3. To make plays(jeux; games) as we have never seen before.<br><br>
 In 2019, "Yume-no-Kyusaku" by the company won the SAF vol.13 award.</p>
